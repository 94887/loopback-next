summary: LoopBack 4 TodoList Application Tutorial - Setting up MySQL in Docker
---

Here are the instructions for getting MySQL running in a docker container for
the purposes of running the TodoList example against a relational database.

## Install Docker

For downloading and installing docker, see
[Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for instructions on how to
install it on your respective operating system.

## Get MySQL docker image

```sh
docker pull mysql/mysql-server:latest
```

## List MySQL docker image

```sh
docker images
```

outputs:

```sh
REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE
mysql/mysql-server latest 8a3a24ad33be 2 months ago 366MB
```

## Create a docker container based on the image, and set root password and port

We will give the docker container a name of `todo-mysql` and we will give the
`root` user a password of `my-secret-pw`.

```sh
docker run --name todo-mysql -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw  -d mysql/mysql-server
```

outputs a UUID for the container:

```sh
191508fcbcfd3b683fea06bb3c8a2f1f252527a15891b58b124518cf2cb60249
```

If the operating system complains that your 3306 port is already being used on
your machine, you can remove the container, and try a different port number.

```sh
docker rm todo-mysql
docker run --name todo-mysql -p 3307:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw -d mysql/mysql-server
```

## View the status of your docker container on your machine

```sh
docker ps

OR

docker ps -a
```

The first lists running containers, and the second lists ALL containers (running
and stopped).

If it's up and running, the output should look like this:

```sh
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                   PORTS                               NAMES
24505c80a83d        mysql/mysql-server   "/entrypoint.sh mysqâ€¦"   7 minutes ago       Up 7 minutes (healthy)   0.0.0.0:3306->3306/tcp, 33060/tcp   todo-mysql
```

## Fixing the root user info in the database

Recent versions of MySQL use
[SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/caching-sha2-pluggable-authentication.html).

A lot of Node.js application are accustomed to the previous authentication
method in MySQL named
[Native Pluggable Authentication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/native-pluggable-authentication.html).

For the purposes of this TodoList example application, we need to have MySQL
switch to the `native` authentication method.

In order to accomplish this, we need to delete the root user's definition, and
create the root user again but with a different definition.

Open up a MySQL interactive prompt into the container

```sh
docker exec -it todo-mysql mysql -uroot -p
```

This opens the `mysql` interactive prompt. You will be prompted for the
password. Enter `my-secret-pw`.

Perform the following commands:

```sh
show databases;
use mysql;
SELECT user,host FROM user;
```

You should see the user `'root'@'localhost'` listed in the results

Continue with the following commands:

```sh
drop user 'root'@'localhost';
CREATE USER 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'my-secret-pw';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Type `exit` to get out of the interactive shell

Now stop and start the container.

```sh
docker stop todo-mysql
docker start todo-mysql
```

We need to go in again and change one more thing (we are not able to do it in
the same mysql session.)

Open the mysql prompt again:

```sh
docker exec -it todo-mysql mysql -uroot -p
```

You will be prompted for the password. Enter `my-secret-pw`.

Perform the following commands:

```sh
use mysql;
ALTER USER 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'my-secret-pw';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Type `exit` to get out of the interactive shell

Now stop and start the container.

```sh
docker stop todo-mysql
docker start todo-mysql
```

Check the logs of the container to see if everything is ok.

```sh
docker logs todo-mysql
```

You should see output like this:

```

Looks like everything is OK.

## IP Address of the MySQL Docker container

For Mac and Linux users, the IP address of the docker container running on your
machine will be the IP address of your machine : `127.0.0.1` .

For Windows users, it isn't, and you can find the proper IP address by issuing
the command

```sh
docker-machine ip default
```

You need to know the proper IP address and port values of your MySQL database
when you set the `host` and `port` values in your `db.datasource.ts` file.
[Specifying the datasource properties](./todo-list-tutorial-sqldb.md#specifying-the-datasource-properties).
